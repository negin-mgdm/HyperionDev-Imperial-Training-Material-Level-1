1. An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input.

SET variable named largest to 0
READ a positive number and store in variable x
WHILE x!=0
    IF x>largest
        SET largest to x
    END IF
READ a positive number and store in variable x
END WHILE
PRINT largest


2. An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase "Hello, World"	

SET first_name as a variable  
READ a name from user and store in first_name
PRINT "Hello, World " + first_name


3. An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average.

SET total_integers to 0
SET counter to 1
READ number of integers from user 
SET number_of_integers to user input

WHILE counter is less than or equal to number_of_integers
    READ an integer from the user
    ADD the user's integer to total_integers
    INCREMENT counter by 1
END WHILE

CALCULATE the average by dividing total_integers by number_of_integers
PRINT "The arithmetic average is: " + average


4. An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy (you can decide what these are).

READ a series of itemes and store in grocery_list 
SORT items in grocery_list  according to alphabetical order
WHILE next item in grocery_list exists
    SET current_item variable as next item in grocery_list
    IF current_item is left to buy
        PRINT current_item 
END WHILE


5. An algorithm for the flowchart below:

READ an integer and SET the value in variable X
READ an integer and SET the value in variable Y

SET S as the sum of x and y
SET A as the result of dividing S by 2
SET P as the product of x and y

PRINT "Sum (S): " + S
PRINT "Average (A): " + A
PRINT "Product (P): " + P
